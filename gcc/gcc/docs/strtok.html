strtok, strtok_r - split string into tokens

<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="string.h.html">string.h</a>&gt;

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_224">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
A sequence of calls to
<i>strtok()</i>
breaks the string pointed to by
<i>s1</i>
into a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a
byte from the string pointed to by
<i>s2</i>.
The first call in the sequence has
<i>s1</i>
as its first argument, and is followed by calls with a null
pointer as their first argument.
The separator string pointed to by
<i>s2</i>
may be different from call to call.
<p>
The first call in the sequence searches the string pointed to by
<i>s1</i>
for the first byte that is
<i>not</i>
contained in the current separator string pointed to by
<i>s2</i>.
If no such byte is found, then there are no tokens in the
string pointed to by
<i>s1</i>
and
<i>strtok()</i>
returns a null pointer.  If such a byte is found, it is the start of the first
token.
<p>
The
<i>strtok()</i>
function then searches from there for a byte that
<i>is</i>
contained in the current separator string.
If no such byte is found, the current token extends to the
end of the string pointed to by
<i>s1</i>,
and subsequent searches for a token will return a null pointer.
If such a byte is found, it is overwritten by a
null byte, which terminates the current token.
The
<i>strtok()</i>
function saves a pointer to the following byte, from which
the next search for a token will start.
<p>
Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the
first argument, starts searching from the saved pointer and
behaves as described above.
<p>
The implementation will behave as if no function defined in this document
calls
<i>strtok()</i>.
<p>
The
<i>strtok()</i>
interface need not be reentrant.
<p>
The function
<i>strtok_r()</i>
considers the null-terminated string
<i>s</i>
as a sequence of zero or more text tokens
separated by spans of one or more characters from the separator string
<i>sep</i>.
The argument
<i>lasts</i>
points to a user-provided pointer
which points to stored information necessary for
<i>strtok_r()</i>
to continue scanning the same string.
<p>
In the first call to
<i>strtok_r()</i>,
<i>s</i>
points to a null-terminated string,
<i>sep</i>
to a null-terminated string of separator characters
and the value pointed to by
<i>lasts</i>
is ignored.
The function
<i>strtok_r()</i>
returns a pointer to the first character of the first token,
writes a null character into
<i>s</i>
immediately following the returned token,
and updates the pointer to which
<i>lasts</i>
points.
<p>
In subsequent calls,
<i>s</i>
is a NULL pointer and
<i>lasts</i>
will be unchanged from the previous call
so that subsequent calls will move through the string
<i>s</i>,
returning successive tokens until no tokens remain.
The separator string
<i>sep</i>
may be different from call to call.
When no token remains in
<i>s</i>,
a NULL pointer is returned.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_225">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>strtok()</i>
returns a pointer to the first byte of a token.  Otherwise, if there is no
token,
<i>strtok()</i>
returns a null pointer.
<p>
The function
<i>strtok_r()</i>
returns a pointer to the token found,
or a NULL pointer when no token is found.
