<h4><a name = "tag_000_009_240">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
strtoul - convert string to an unsigned long
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_241">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdlib.h.html">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

unsigned long int strtoul(const char *<i>str</i>, char *<i>*endptr</i>, int <i>base</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_242">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>strtoul()</i>
function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by
<i>str</i>
to a type
<b>unsigned long int</b>
representation.
First it decomposes the input string into three parts: an initial,
possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as specified by
<i><a href="isspace.html">isspace()</a></i>);
a subject sequence interpreted as an integer represented
in some radix determined by the value of
<i>base</i>;
and a final string of one or more unrecognised characters,
including the terminating null byte of the input string.
Then it attempts to convert the subject sequence to an unsigned integer,
and returns the result.
<p>
If the value of
<i>base</i>
is 0, the expected form of the subject sequence is that of a
decimal constant, octal constant or hexadecimal constant,
any of which may be preceded by a + or - sign.
A decimal constant begins with a non-zero digit, and consists
of a sequence of decimal digits.
An octal constant consists of the prefix
0 optionally followed by a sequence of the digits 0 to 7 only.
A hexadecimal constant consists of the prefix
0x or 0X followed by a sequence of the decimal digits and letters
a (or A) to f (or F) with values 10 to 15 respectively.
<p>
If the value of
<i>base</i>
is between 2 and 36, the expected form of the subject sequence is
a sequence of letters and digits representing an integer with the
radix specified by
<i>base</i>,
optionally preceded by a + or - sign.
The letters from a (or A) to z (or Z) inclusive
are ascribed the values 10 to 35; only letters whose ascribed
values are less than that of
<i>base</i>
are permitted.
If the value of
<i>base</i>
is 16, the characters 0x or 0X
may optionally precede the sequence of letters and digits,
following the sign if present.
<p>
The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
subsequence of the input string, starting with the first
non-white-space character, that is of the expected form.
The subject sequence contains no characters if the input string
is empty or consists entirely of white-space characters,
or if the first
non-white-space character is other than a sign or a permissible
letter or digit.
<p>
If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of
<i>base</i>
is 0, the sequence of characters starting with the first digit
is interpreted as an integer constant.
If the subject sequence has the expected form and the value of
<i>base</i>
is between 2 and 36, it is used as the base for conversion,
ascribing to each letter its value as given above.
If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value
resulting from the conversion is negated.
A pointer to the final string is stored in the object pointed to
by
<i>endptr</i>,
provided that
<i>endptr</i>
is not a null pointer.
<p>
In other than the POSIX locale, additional implementation-dependent
subject sequence forms may be accepted.
<p>
If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected
form, no conversion is performed; the value of
<i>str</i>
is stored in the object pointed to by
<i>endptr</i>,
provided that
<i>endptr</i>
is not a null pointer.
<p>
The
<i>strtoul()</i>
function will not change the setting of 
<b>errno</b>
if successful.
<p>
Because 0 and ULONG_MAX are returned on error and are also
valid returns on success, an application wishing to check for error
situations should set
<i>errno</i>
to 0, then call
<i>strtoul()</i>,
then check
<i>errno</i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_243">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion
<i>strtoul()</i>
returns the converted value, if any.
If no conversion could be performed, 0 is returned
&nbsp;and
<i>errno</i>
may be set to [EINVAL].
If the correct value is outside the range of representable
values, ULONG_MAX is returned and
<i>errno</i>
is set to [ERANGE].
<br>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_244">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>strtoul()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
The value of
<i>base</i>
is not supported.

<dt>[ERANGE]<dd>
The value to be returned is not representable.

</dl>
<p>
The
<i>strtoul()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
No conversion could be performed.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_245">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_246">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
Unlike
<i><a href="strtod.html">strtod()</a></i>
and
<i><a href="strtol.html">strtol()</a></i>,
<i>strtoul()</i>
must always return a non-negative number; so, using the
return value of
<i>strtoul()</i>
for out-of-range numbers with
<i>strtoul()</i>
could cause more severe problems than just loss
of precision if those numbers can ever be negative.
