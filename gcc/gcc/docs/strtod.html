<h4><a name = "tag_000_009_213">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
strtod - convert string to a double-precision number
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_214">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdlib.h.html">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

double strtod(const char *<i>str</i>, char **<i>endptr</i>);

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_215">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>strtod()</i>
function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by
<i>str</i>
to type
<b>double</b>
representation.
First it decomposes the input string into three parts: an
initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as
specified by
<i><a href="isspace.html">isspace()</a></i>);
a subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point
constant; and a final string of one or more unrecognised
characters, including the terminating null byte of the input
string.
Then it attempts to convert the subject sequence to a
floating-point number, and returns the result.
<p>
The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional + or
- sign, then a non-empty sequence of digits optionally containing a
radix character, then an optional exponent part.
An exponent part consists of e or E,
followed by an optional sign, followed by one or more decimal digits.
The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of
the input string, starting with the first non-white-space character,
that is of the expected form.
The subject sequence is empty if the input string
is empty or consists entirely of white-space characters, or if the first
character that is not white space is other than a sign, a digit or a
radix character.
<p>
If the subject sequence has the expected form, the sequence
starting with the first digit or the radix character
(whichever occurs first) is interpreted as a
floating constant of the C language,
except that the radix character is used in
place of a period, and that if neither an exponent part nor a
radix character appears, a radix character is assumed to
follow the last digit in the string.
If the subject sequence begins with a minus sign, the value
resulting from the conversion is negated.
A pointer to the final string is stored in the object pointed to
by
<i>endptr</i>,
provided that
<i>endptr</i>
is not a null pointer.
<p>
The radix character is defined in the program's locale
(category LC_NUMERIC).
In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix character is
not defined, the radix character defaults to a period (.).
<p>
In other than the POSIX locale, other implementation-dependent
subject sequence forms may be accepted.
<p>
If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected
form, no conversion is performed; the value of
<i>str</i>
is stored in the object pointed to by
<i>endptr</i>,
provided that
<i>endptr</i>
is not a null pointer.
<br>
<p>
The
<i>strtod()</i>
function will not change the setting of 
<b>errno</b>
if successful.
<p>
Because 0 is returned on error and is also a valid return on success, an
application wishing to check for error situations should set
<i>errno</i>
to 0, then call
<i>strtod()</i>,
then check
<i>errno</i>.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_216">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>strtod()</i>
returns the converted value.
If no conversion could be performed, 0 is returned,
&nbsp;and
<i>errno</i>
may be set to [EINVAL].
<p>
If the correct value is outside the range of representable
values, &plusmn;HUGE_VAL
is returned (according to the sign of the value), and
<i>errno</i>
is set to [ERANGE].
<p>
If the correct value would cause an underflow, 0 is returned and
<i>errno</i>
is set to [ERANGE].
<br>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_217">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>strtod()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[ERANGE]<dd>
The value to be returned would cause overflow or underflow.

</dl>
<p>
The
<i>strtod()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
No conversion could be performed.
