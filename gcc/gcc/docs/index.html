<h1> Editor and Compiler Help </h1>

<h2> Editor </h2>
The editor looks something like this:<p>
<img src=jfe.gif><p>

The editor has lots of fancy features that you can probably find by trial and error. 
Put the cursor over an icon and a message will appear telling you what it does.
Press F1 and the editor will try to find help for the function or keyword at the cursor.
<p><img src=image13.gif> Create a New Document - When the document must be saved you will be asked to provide a name and folder for it.
<p><img src=image14.gif> Open File - Open an existing file, the default folder is where a file was last opened or saved.

<p><img src=image15.gif> Save File - Save the current document, 
if this icon is red then the text has been changed singe it was last saved.
<p><img src=image16.gif> Print File - Prints the current document.
<p><img src=image17.gif> Cut - Delete currently selected text.
<p><img src=image18.gif> Copy - Copy currently selected text.
<p><img src=image19.gif> Paste - Insert last deleted or copied text into the current document.
<p><img src=image20.gif> Undo - Undo what you have done - be careful, there is no redo. 
<p><img src=image21.gif> Show Line Numbers - Line numbers appear on the left side of each document.
<p><img src=image22.gif> Show Functions - The names of your functions appear in a tree window. Click on a
+ to view the functions and click on a name to navigate your program.
<p><img src=image23.gif> Show C Syntax Highlighting - Displays keywords, comments, strings etc in different colors.
<p><img src=image4.gif> Show Console Window - When this is selected, programs are run in the same console window and it remains on the screen after the program has finished.
Otherwise programs create a new console window each time they are run that disappears automatically.
<p><img src=image24.gif> Previous Document - Moves to the last Document (or function) 
you were editing
<p><img src=image25.gif> Next Document - Moves to the next Document (or function) 
you are editing
<p><img src=image26.gif> Find - Find some text in the current Document.
<p><img src=image27.gif> Search Files - Find some text in all the open documents or in all the files on disk.
<p><img src=image28.gif> Replace - Replace all occurances of some text.
<p><img src=image29.gif> Goto Line - Specify a line number to move to.
<p><img src=image30.gif> Bookmark - Add an icon to the toolbar for the the current line.
<p><img src=image31.gif> Cancel Tool - Stop the compilation of a program.
<p><img src=image32.gif> Compile - Compile the current document using a C++ compiler 
to produce an object file. The file is automatically saved first.
Output from the compiler is sent to the window at the bottom of the editor. 
Just click on an error line in this window to move to the corresponding line in the program.
<p><img src=image33.gif> Run Program - Execute the program, if necessary compile and/or link first.
<p><img src=image34.gif> Help - Try to find help for the function or keyword
at the current cursor position.
<p>
If the editor ever gets into a state where you have changed lots of options and don't
know how to change them back, just copy the default ini file jfedef.ini to jfe.ini.
<h2> Compiler </h2>
The compiler is g++ version 2.95.
It is a 32 bit C++ compiler and it should do everything you need.
Executables are linked with the windows dlls so you have win32 window, process, console and network functions available.
To see the complete list of options for g++, run the batch file options.bat in gcc\bin.
