<h4><a name = "tag_000_004_065">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
exit, _exit - terminate a process
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_066">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdlib.h.html">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

void exit(int <i>status</i>);

#include &lt;<a href="unistd.h.html">unistd.h</a>&gt;

void _exit(int <i>status</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_004_067">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>exit()</i>
function first calls all functions registered by
<i><a href="atexit.html">atexit()</a></i>,
in the reverse order of their registration.
Each function is called as many times as it was registered.
<p>
If a function registered by a call to
<i><a href="atexit.html">atexit()</a></i>
fails to return, the remaining registered functions
are not called and the rest of the
<i>exit()</i>
processing is not completed. If
<i>exit()</i>
is called more than once, the effects are undefined.
<p>
The
<i>exit()</i>
function then flushes all output streams, closes all open streams,
and removes all files created by
<i><a href="tmpfile.html">tmpfile()</a></i>.
Finally, control is returned to the host environment as described
below.
The values of
<i>status</i>
can be EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE,
as described in
<i><a href="stdlib.h.html">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</a></i>,
or any implementation-dependent value, although note that only the range
0 through 255 will be available to a waiting parent process.
<p>
The
<i>_exit()</i>
and
<i>exit()</i>
functions terminate the calling process with the following consequences:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
All of the file descriptors, directory streams,
&nbsp;conversion descriptors and message catalogue descriptors
open in the calling process are closed.
<p>
<li>
If the parent process of the calling process is executing a
<i><a href="wait.html">wait()</a></i>,
<i><a href="wait3.html">wait3()</a></i>,
<i><a href="waitid.html">waitid()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="waitpid.html">waitpid()</a></i>,
and has neither set its SA_NOCLDWAIT flag nor set SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN,
it is notified of the calling process'
termination and the low-order eight bits (that is, bits 0377) of
<i>status</i>
are made available to it.  If the parent is not waiting, the child's status
will be made available to it when the parent subsequently executes
<i><a href="wait.html">wait()</a></i>,
<i><a href="wait3.html">wait3()</a></i>,
<i><a href="waitid.html">waitid()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="waitpid.html">waitpid()</a></i>.
<p>
<li>
If the parent process of the calling process is not
executing a
<i><a href="wait.html">wait()</a></i>,
<i><a href="wait3.html">wait3()</a></i>,
<i><a href="waitid.html">waitid()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="waitpid.html">waitpid()</a></i>,
and has not set its SA_NOCLDWAIT flag,
or set SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN,
the calling process is transformed into a <i>zombie process</i>.
A <i>zombie process</i> is an inactive process
and it will be deleted at some later time
when its parent process executes
<i><a href="wait.html">wait()</a></i>,
<i><a href="wait3.html">wait3()</a></i>,
<i><a href="waitid.html">waitid()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="waitpid.html">waitpid()</a></i>.
<p>
<li>
Termination of a process does not directly terminate its children. The
sending of a SIGHUP
signal as described below indirectly terminates children in some
circumstances.
<p>
<li>
If the implementation supports the SIGCHLD
signal, a SIGCHLD
will be sent to the parent process.
<p>
<li>
If the parent process has set its SA_NOCLDWAIT flag,
or set SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN, the status will be
discarded, and the lifetime of the calling process will end immediately.
If SA_NOCLDWAIT is set, it is implementation-dependent whether a
SIGCHLD signal will be sent to the parent process.
<p>
<li>
The parent process ID of all of the calling process'
existing child processes and zombie processes is set to the
process ID of an implementation-dependent system process.
That is, these processes are inherited by a special system process.
<p>
<li>
Each attached shared-memory segment is detached and the value of
<i>shm_nattch</i>
(see
<i><a href="shmget.html">shmget()</a></i>)
in the data structure associated with its shared memory ID
is decremented by&nbsp;1.
<br>
<p>
<li>
For each semaphore for which the calling process has set a
<i>semadj</i>
value, see
<i><a href="semop.html">semop()</a></i>,
that value is added to the
<i>semval</i>
of the specified semaphore.
<p>
<li>
If the process is a controlling process, the SIGHUP
signal will be sent to each process in the foreground process group
of the controlling terminal belonging to the calling process.
<p>
<li>
If the process is a controlling process, the controlling terminal
associated with the session is disassociated from the session, allowing
it to be acquired by a new controlling process.
<br>
<p>
<li>
If the exit of the
process causes a process group to become orphaned, and if any member
of the newly-orphaned process group is stopped, then
a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT
signal will be sent to each process in the newly-orphaned process group.
<p>
<li>
If the Semaphores option is supported, all open named semaphores
in the calling process are closed as if by appropriate calls to
<i><a href="sem_close.html">sem_close()</a></i>.
<p>
<li>
If the Process Memory Locking option is supported,
any memory locks established by the process via calls to
<i><a href="mlockall.html">mlockall()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="mlock.html">mlock()</a></i>
are removed.
If locked pages in the address space of the calling process
are also mapped into the address spaces
of other processes and are locked by those processes,
the locks established by the other processes will be unaffected
by the call by this process to
<i>_exit()</i>.
<p>
<li>
Memory mappings created in the process are unmapped
before the process is destroyed.
<p>
<li>
If the Message Passing option is supported,
all open message queue descriptors in the calling process are
closed as if by appropriate calls to
<i><a href="mq_close.html">mq_close()</a></i>.
<p>
<li>
If the Asynchronous Input and Output option is supported
any outstanding cancelable asynchronous I/O operations may be
canceled.
Those asynchronous I/O operations that are not canceled will complete
as if the
<i>_exit()</i>
operation had not yet occurred,
but any associated signal notifications will be suppressed.
The
<i>_exit()</i>
operation itself may block awaiting such I/O completion.
Whether any I/O is cancelled, and which I/O may be cancelled upon
<i>_exit()</i>,
is implementation-dependent.
<p>
<li>
Threads terminated by a call to
<i>_exit()</i>
will not invoke their cancellation cleanup handlers or per-thread data
destructors.
<p>
