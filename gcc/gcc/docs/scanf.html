<h4><a name = "tag_000_005_266">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
fscanf, scanf, sscanf  - convert formatted input
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_267">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdio.h.html">stdio.h</a>&gt;

int fscanf(FILE *<i>stream</i>, const char *<i>format</i>, ... );
int scanf(const char *<i>format</i>, ... );
int sscanf(const char *<i>s</i>, const char *<i>format</i>, ... );

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_268">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fscanf()</i>
function reads from the named input
<i>stream</i>.
The
<i>scanf()</i>
function reads from the standard input stream
<i><a href="stdin.html">stdin</a></i>.
The
<i>sscanf()</i>
function reads from the string
<i>s</i>.
Each function reads bytes, interprets
them according to a format, and stores the results in its arguments.
Each expects, as arguments, a control string
<i>format</i>
described below, and a set of
<i>pointer</i>
arguments
indicating where the converted input should be stored.
The result is undefined if there are insufficient arguments for
the format.
If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments
are evaluated but are otherwise ignored.
<p>
Conversions can be applied to the
<i>nth</i>
argument after the
<i>format</i>
in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument.
In this case, the conversion character % (see below) is replaced
by the sequence %<i>n</i>$, where <i>n</i> is a decimal integer
in the range [1,&nbsp;{NL_ARGMAX}].
This feature provides for the definition of format strings that
select arguments in an order appropriate to specific languages.
In format strings
containing the %<i>n</i>$ form of conversion specifications,
it is unspecified whether numbered
arguments in the argument list can be referenced from the format string
more than once.
<p>
The
<i>format</i>
can contain either form of a conversion specification, that is, %
or %<i>n</i>$, but the two forms cannot normally be mixed within a single
<i>format</i>
string.
The only exception to this is that %% or %* can be mixed with the
%<i>n</i>$ form.
<p>
The
<i>fscanf()</i>
function in all its forms allows for detection of a language-dependent radix
character in the input string.  The radix character is defined
in the program's locale (category LC_NUMERIC).
In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where
the radix character is not defined,
the radix character defaults to a period (.).
<p>
The format is a character string, beginning and ending in its
initial shift state, if any, composed of zero or more directives.
Each directive is composed of one of the following:
one or more white-space characters (space, tab, newline, vertical-tab
or form-feed characters); an ordinary character (neither % nor a
white-space character);
or a conversion specification.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %
or the character sequence
<i>%n$</i>
after which the following appear in sequence:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
An optional assignment-suppressing character *.
<p>
<li>
An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field
width.
<p>
<li>
An optional size modifier h, l (ell) or L
indicating the size of the receiving object.
The conversion characters d, i and n must be preceded by h
if the corresponding argument is a pointer to
<b>short int</b>
rather than a pointer to
<b>int</b>,
or by l (ell) if it is a pointer to
<b>long int</b>.
Similarly, the conversion characters o, u and x must be preceded by h
if the corresponding argument is a pointer to
<b>unsigned short int</b>
rather than a pointer to
<b>unsigned int</b>,
or by l (ell) if it is a pointer to
<b>unsigned long int</b>.
The conversion characters e, f and g must be preceded by l (ell)
if the corresponding argument is a pointer to
<b>double</b>
rather than a pointer to
<b>float</b>,
or by L if it is a pointer to
<b>long double</b>.
Finally, the conversion characters c, s and [ must be precede by l
(ell) if the corresponding argument is a pointer to
<b>wchar_t</b>
rather than a pointer to a character type.
If an h, l (ell) or L
appears with any other conversion character, the behaviour is undefined.
<p>
<li>
A conversion character
that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The valid conversion characters are described below.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
The
<i>fscanf()</i>
functions execute each directive of the format in turn.  If a directive fails,
as detailed below, the function returns.  Failures are described as input
failures (due to the unavailability of input bytes) or matching failures (due
to inappropriate input).
<p>
A directive composed of one or more white-space characters is
executed by reading input until no more valid input can be read, or
up to the first byte which is not a white-space character
which remains unread.
<p>
A directive that is an ordinary character is executed as
follows.
The next byte is read from the input and compared with the
byte that comprises the directive;
if the comparison shows that they are not equivalent,
the directive fails, and the differing and subsequent
bytes remain unread.
<p>
A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of
matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion character.
A conversion specification is executed in the following steps:
<p>
Input white-space characters (as specified by
<i><a href="isspace.html">isspace()</a></i>)
are skipped, unless the conversion specification includes a
[, c, C or n conversion character.
<p>
An item is read from the input, unless the conversion specification
includes an n conversion character.
An input item is defined as the longest sequence of input bytes
(up to any specified maximum field width, which may be measured in
characters or bytes dependent on the conversion character) which is an
initial subsequence of a matching sequence.
The first byte, if any, after the input item remains unread.
If the length of the input item is 0, the execution of the
conversion specification fails;
this condition is a matching failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding
error, or a read error prevented
input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.
<p>
Except in the case of a % conversion character, the input item (or, in the
case of a
<i>%n</i>
conversion specification, the count of input bytes)
is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion character.
If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of
the conversion specification fails; this condition is a matching failure.
Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a *,
the result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to
by the first argument following the
<i>format</i>
argument that has not already received a conversion result
if the conversion specification is introduced by %,
&nbsp;or in the
<i>n</i>th
argument if introduced by the character sequence
<i>%n$</i>.
&nbsp;If this object does not have an appropriate type, or if the
result of the conversion cannot be represented in the space
provided, the behaviour is undefined.
<p>
The following conversion characters are valid:
<dl compact>

<dt>d<dd>Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the
same as expected for the subject sequence of
<i><a href="strtol.html">strtol()</a></i>
with the value 10 for the
<i>base</i>
argument.
In the absence of a size modifier, the corresponding argument
must be a pointer to
<b>int</b>.

<dt>i<dd>Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is the same as
expected for the subject sequence of
<i><a href="strtol.html">strtol()</a></i>
with 0 for the
<i>base</i>
argument.
In the absence of a size modifier, the corresponding argument
must be a pointer to
<b>int</b>.

<dt>o<dd>Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as
expected for the subject sequence of
<i><a href="strtoul.html">strtoul()</a></i>
with the value 8 for the
<i>base</i>
argument.
In the absence of a size modifier, the corresponding argument
must be a pointer to
<b>unsigned int</b>.

<dt>u<dd>Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the
same as expected for the subject sequence of
<i><a href="strtoul.html">strtoul()</a></i>
with the value 10 for the
<i>base</i>
argument.
In the absence of a size modifier, the corresponding argument
must be a pointer to
<b>unsigned int</b>.

<dt>x<dd>Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is
the same as expected for the subject sequence of
<i><a href="strtoul.html">strtoul()</a></i>
with the value 16 for the
<i>base</i>
argument.
In the absence of a size modifier, the corresponding argument
must be a pointer to
<b>unsigned int</b>.

<dt>e,&nbsp;f,&nbsp;g<dd>Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, whose format is
the same as expected for the subject sequence of
<i><a href="strtod.html">strtod()</a></i>.
In the absence of a size modifier, the corresponding argument
must be a pointer to
<b>float</b>.

If the 
<i><a href="fprintf.html">fprintf()</a></i>
family of functions generates character string
representations for infinity and NaN (a 7858 symbolic entity encoded
in floating-point format) to support the ANSI/IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;754:1985 standard, the 
<i>fscanf()</i>
family of functions will recognise them as input.

<dt>s<dd>Matches a sequence of bytes that are not white-space characters.
The corresponding argument must be a pointer to the initial
byte of an array of
<b>char</b>,
<b>signed char</b>
or
<b>unsigned char</b>
large enough to accept the sequence and a
terminating null character code, which will be added automatically.

If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the input is a sequence of
characters that begins in the initial shift state.  Each
character is converted to a wide-character as if by a call
to the
<i><a href="mbrtowc.html">mbrtowc()</a></i>
function, with the conversion state described by an
<b>mbstate_t</b>
object initialised to zero before the first character is
converted.  The corresponding argument must be a pointer to an array
of
<b>wchar_t</b>
large enough to accept the sequence and the terminating null 
wide-character, which will be added automatically.

<dt>[<dd>Matches a non-empty sequence of bytes from a set of expected
bytes (the
<i>scanset</i>).
The normal skip over white-space characters is suppressed in this case.
The corresponding argument must be a pointer to the initial
byte of an array of
<b>char</b>,
<b>signed char</b>
or
<b>unsigned char</b>
large enough to accept the sequence and a
terminating null byte, which will be added automatically.

If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the input is a sequence of
characters that begins in the initial shift state.  Each
character in the sequence is converted to a wide-character
as if by a call to the
<i><a href="mbrtowc.html">mbrtowc()</a></i>
function, with the conversion state described by an
<b>mbstate_t</b>
object initialised to zero before the first character is
converted.  The corresponding argument must be a pointer to an array
of
<b>wchar_t</b>
large enough to accept the sequence and the terminating null
wide-character, which will be added automatically.

The conversion specification includes all subsequent bytes in
the
<i>format</i>
string up to and including the matching right square bracket (]).
The bytes between the square brackets (the
<i>scanlist</i>)
comprise the scanset, unless the byte after the left square bracket
is a circumflex (^), in which case the scanset contains all
bytes that do not appear in the scanlist between the
circumflex and the right square bracket.
If the conversion specification begins with []
or [^], the right square bracket is included in the scanlist and the
next right square bracket is the matching right square bracket that ends the
conversion specification; otherwise the first right square bracket is the
one that ends the conversion specification.
If a - is in the scanlist and is not the first character, nor the second
where the first character is a ^, nor the last character,
the behaviour is implementation-dependent.

<dt>c<dd>Matches a sequence of bytes of the number specified by the
field width (1 if no field width is present in the conversion specification).
The corresponding argument must be a pointer to the initial
byte of an array of <b>char</b>, <b>signed&nbsp;char</b> or <b>unsigned char</b>
large enough to accept the sequence.
No null byte is added.
The normal skip over white-space characters is suppressed in this case.

If an l (ell) qualifier is present, the input is a sequence of
characters that begins in the initial shift state.  Each
character in the sequence is converted to a wide-character
as if by a call to the
<i><a href="mbrtowc.html">mbrtowc()</a></i>
function, with the conversion state described by an
<b>mbstate_t</b>
object initialised to zero before the first character is
converted.  The corresponding argument must be a pointer to an array
of
<b>wchar_t</b>
large enough to accept the resulting sequence of wide-characters.  No
null wide-character is added.

<dt>p<dd>Matches an implementation-dependent set of sequences, which must
be the same as the set of sequences that is produced by the %p
conversion of the corresponding
<i><a href="fprintf.html">fprintf()</a></i>
functions.
The corresponding argument must be a pointer to a pointer to
<b>void</b>.
The interpretation of the input item is implementation-dependent.
If the input item is a value converted earlier during the
same program execution, the pointer that results will compare equal
to that value; otherwise the behaviour of the %p conversion is undefined.

<dt>n<dd>No input is consumed.
The corresponding argument must be a pointer to
the integer into which is to be written the number of
bytes read from the input so far by this call to the
<i>fscanf()</i>
functions.
Execution of a %n
conversion specification
does not increment the assignment count returned at the
completion of execution of the function.

<dt>C<dd>Same as lc.

<dt>S<dd>Same as ls.

<dt>%<dd>Matches a single %;
no conversion or assignment occurs.
The complete conversion specification must be %%.

</dl>
<p>
If a conversion specification is invalid, the behaviour is
undefined.
<p>
The conversion characters E, G and X
are also valid and behave the same as, respectively, e, g and x.
<p>
If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion is terminated.
If end-of-file occurs before any bytes matching the current
conversion specification (except for
%n) have been read
(other than leading white-space characters, where
permitted), execution of the current conversion specification
terminates with an
input failure.  Otherwise, unless execution of the current
conversion specification is terminated with a matching failure,
execution of the following conversion specification (if any)
is terminated with an input failure.
<p>
Reaching the end of the string in
<i>sscanf()</i>
is equivalent to encountering end-of-file for
<i>fscanf()</i>.
<p>
If conversion terminates on a conflicting input, the
offending input is left unread in the input.
Any trailing white space (including newline characters) is left
unread unless matched by a conversion specification.
The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is only
directly determinable via the %n conversion specification.
<p>
The
<i>fscanf()</i>
and
<i>scanf()</i>
functions may mark the
<i>st_atime</i>
field of the file associated with
<i>stream</i>
for update.
The
<i>st_atime</i>
field will be marked for update by the first successful execution of

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_269">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion, these functions return the number of successfully
matched and assigned input items; this number can be 0 in the event of an
early matching failure.  If the input ends before the first matching failure
or conversion, EOF is returned.  If a read error occurs the error indicator
for the stream is set, EOF is returned, and
<i>errno</i>
is set to indicate the error.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_270">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
For the conditions under which the
<i>fscanf()</i>
functions will fail and may fail, refer to
<i><a href="fgetc.html">fgetc()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="fgetwc.html">fgetwc()</a></i>.
<p>
In addition,
<i>fscanf()</i>
may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EILSEQ]<dd>
Input byte sequence does not form a valid character.

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
There are insufficient arguments.
