<h4><a name = "tag_000_005_023">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
fflush - flush a stream
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_024">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdio.h.html">stdio.h</a>&gt;

int fflush(FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_025">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
If
<i>stream</i>
points to an output stream or an update stream in which the most
recent operation was not input,
<i>fflush()</i>
causes any unwritten data for that stream to be written to the file, and the
<i>st_ctime</i>
and
<i>st_mtime</i>
fields of the underlying file are marked for update.
<p>
If
<i>stream</i>
is a null pointer,
<i>fflush()</i>
performs this flushing action on all streams for which
the behaviour is defined above.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_026">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>fflush()</i>
returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns EOF and sets
<i>errno</i>
to indicate the error.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_027">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fflush()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EAGAIN]<dd>
The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor underlying
<i>stream</i>
and the process would be delayed in the write operation.

<dt>[EBADF]<dd>
The file descriptor underlying
<i>stream</i>
is not valid.

<dt>[EFBIG]<dd>
An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size
or the process' file size limit.

<dt>[EFBIG]<dd>
The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or beyond
the offset maximum associated with the corresponding stream.

<dt>[EINTR]<dd>
The
<i>fflush()</i>
function was interrupted by a signal.

<dt>[EIO]<dd>
The process is a member
of a background process group attempting to write to its
controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the process is neither ignoring nor
blocking SIGTTOU and the process group of the process is
orphaned.
This error may also be returned under implementation-dependent conditions.

<dt>[ENOSPC]<dd>
There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.

<dt>[EPIPE]<dd>
An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open
for reading by any process.
A SIGPIPE signal will also be sent to the thread.

</dl>
<p>
The
<i>fflush()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[ENXIO]<dd>
A request was made of a non-existent device, or the request was
outside the capabilities of the device.
