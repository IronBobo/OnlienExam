<h4><a name = "tag_000_009_360">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
system - issue a command
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_361">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdlib.h.html">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

int system(const char *<i>command</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_362">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>system()</i>
function passes the string pointed to by
<i>command</i>
to the host environment to be executed by a command processor in an
implementation-dependent manner.  If the implementation supports
the <b>XCU</b> specification commands, the environment of the executed
command will be as if a child process were created using
<i><a href="fork.html">fork()</a></i>,
and the child process invoked the
<i><a href="../xcu/sh.html">sh</a></i>
utility (see
<i><a href="../xcu/sh.html">sh</a></i>
in the <b>XCU</b> specification) using
<i><a href="exec.html">execl()</a></i>
as follows:
<pre>
<code>
execl(&lt;<i>shell path</i>&gt;, "sh", "-c", <i>command</i>, (char *)0);
</code>
</pre>
where
<i>&lt;shell path&gt;</i>
is an unspecified pathname for the
<i><a href="../xcu/sh.html">sh</a></i>
utility.
<p>
The
<i>system()</i>
function ignores the SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals, and blocks the SIGCHLD
signal, while waiting for the command to terminate.
If this might cause the application to miss a signal that would have
killed it, then the application should examine the return value from
<i>system()</i>
and take whatever action is appropriate to the application if
the command terminated due to receipt of a signal.
<p>
The
<i>system()</i>
function will not affect the termination status of
any child of the calling processes other than the process or
processes it itself creates.
<p>
The
<i>system()</i>
function will not return until the child process has terminated.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_363">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
If
<i>command</i>
is a null pointer,
<i>system()</i>
returns non-zero only if a command processor is available.
<p>
If
<i>command</i>
is not a null pointer,
<i>system()</i>
returns the termination status of the
command language interpreter in the format specified by
<i><a href="waitpid.html">waitpid()</a></i>.
The termination status of the command language interpreter is as
specified for the
<i><a href="../xcu/sh.html">sh</a></i>
utility, except that if some error prevents the command language interpreter
from executing after the child process is created, the return value from
<i>system()</i>
will be as if the command language interpreter
had terminated using
<i>exit</i>(127)
or
<i>_exit</i>(127).
If a child process cannot be created, or if the termination status for the
command language interpreter cannot be obtained,
<i>system()</i>
returns -1 and sets
<i>errno</i>
to indicate the error.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_364">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>system()</i>
function may set
<i>errno</i>
values as described by
<i><a href="fork.html">fork()</a></i>.
<p>
In addition,
<i>system()</i>
may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[ECHILD]<dd>
The status of the child process created by
<i>system()</i>
is no longer available.

</dl>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_365">&nbsp;</a>EXAMPLES</h4><blockquote>
None.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_009_366">&nbsp;</a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4><blockquote>
If the return value of
<i>system()</i>
is not -1, its value can be decoded through the use of the
macros described in
<i><a href="syswait.h.html">&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</a></i>.
For convenience, these macros are also provided in
<i><a href="stdlib.h.html">&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</a></i>.
<p>
To determine whether or not the <b>XCU</b> specification's environment is present, use:
<pre>
<code>
sysconf(_SC_2_VERSION)
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Note that, while
<i>system()</i>
must ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT and block SIGCHLD while waiting for the
child to terminate, the handling of signals in the executed
command is as specified by
<i><a href="fork.html">fork()</a></i>
and
<i>exec</i>.
For example, if
SIGINT is being caught or is set to SIG_DFL when
<i>system()</i>
is called, then the child will be started with
SIGINT handling set to SIG_DFL.
<p>
Ignoring SIGINT and SIGQUIT
in the parent process prevents coordination problems (two processes
reading from the same terminal, for example) when the executed command
ignores or catches one of the signals.
It is also usually the correct action when the user has given a
command to the application to be executed synchronously (as in the "!"
command in many interactive applications).
In either case, the signal should be delivered only to the child
process, not to the application itself.
There is one situation where ignoring the signals might have less than
the desired effect.  This is when the application uses
<i>system()</i>
to perform some task invisible to the user.  If the user typed the interrupt
character (^C, for example) while
<i>system()</i>
is being used in this way, one would expect the application to be killed, but
only the executed command will be killed.  Applications that use
<i>system()</i>
in this way should carefully check the return status from
<i>system()</i>
to see if the executed command was successful, and should take appropriate
action when the command fails.
<p>
Blocking SIGCHLD
while waiting for the child to terminate prevents the application from
catching the signal and obtaining status from
<i>system()</i>'s
child process before
<i>system()</i>
can get the status itself.
<p>
The context in which the utility is ultimately executed may
differ from that in which
<i>system()</i>
was called.
For example, file descriptors that have the FD_CLOEXEC
flag set will be closed, and the process ID and parent process ID
will be different.
Also,
if the executed utility changes its environment
variables or its current working
directory, that change will not be reflected in the caller's context.
<p>
There is no defined way for an application to find the specific path for the
shell.  However,
<i><a href="confstr.html">confstr()</a></i>
can provide a value for
that is guaranteed to find the
<i><a href="../xcu/sh.html">sh</a></i>
utility.
