</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_159">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdio.h.html">stdio.h</a>&gt;

FILE *fopen(const char *<i>filename</i>, const char *<i>mode</i>);

</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_160">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fopen()</i>
function opens the file whose pathname is the string pointed to by
<i>filename</i>,
and associates a stream with it.
<p>
The argument
<i>mode</i>
points to a string beginning with one of the following sequences:
<dl compact>

<dt><b>r</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>rb</b><dd>Open file for reading.

<dt><b>w</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>wb</b><dd>Truncate to zero length or create file for writing.

<dt><b>a</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>ab</b><dd>Append; open or create file for writing at end-of-file.

<dt><b>r+</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>rb+</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>r+b</b><dd>Open file for update (reading and writing).

<dt><b>w+</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>wb+</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>w+b</b><dd>Truncate to zero length or create file for update.

<dt><b>a+</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>ab+</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>a+b</b><dd>Append; open or create file for update, writing at end-of-file.

</dl>
<p>
The character b has no effect, but is allowed for ISO&nbsp;C standard
conformance.
Opening a file with read mode (r as the first character in the
<i>mode</i>
argument) fails if the file does not exist or cannot be read.
<p>
Opening a file with append mode (a as the first character in the
<i>mode</i>
argument) causes all subsequent writes to the file to be forced
to the then current end-of-file, regardless of intervening calls
to
<i><a href="fseek.html">fseek()</a></i>.
<p>
When a file is opened with update mode (+ as the second or third
character in the
<i>mode</i>
argument), both input and output may be performed on the
associated stream.
However, output must not be directly followed by input without an
intervening call to
<i><a href="fflush.html">fflush()</a></i>
or to a file positioning function (.Fn fseek ,
<i><a href="fsetpos.html">fsetpos()</a></i>
or
<i><a href="rewind.html">rewind()</a></i>),
and input must not be directly followed by output without an
intervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input
operation encounters end-of-file.
<p>
When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and only if it can be
determined not to refer to an interactive device.
The error and end-of-file indicators for the stream are cleared.
<p>
If
<i>mode</i>
is <b>w</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>w+</b> or <b>a+</b> and the file
did not previously exist, upon successful completion,
<i>fopen()</i>
function will mark for update the
<i>st_atime</i>,
<i>st_ctime</i>
and
<i>st_mtime</i>
fields of the file and the
<i>st_ctime</i>
and
<i>st_mtime</i>
fields of the parent directory.
<p>
If
<i>mode</i>
is <b>w</b> or <b>w+</b> and the file did previously exist, upon successful
completion,
<i>fopen()</i>
will mark for update the
<i>st_ctime</i>
and
<i>st_mtime</i>
fields of the file.  The
<i>fopen()</i>
function will allocate a file descriptor as
<i><a href="open.html">open()</a></i>
does.
<p>
The largest value that can be represented correctly in an object of type
<b>off_t</b>
will be established as the offset maximum in the open file description.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_161">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>fopen()</i>
returns a pointer to the object controlling the stream.  Otherwise, a null
pointer is returned, and
<i>errno</i>
is set to indicate the error.
<br>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_162">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>fopen()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EACCES]<dd>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix,
or the file exists and the permissions specified by
<i>mode</i>
are denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is
denied for the parent directory of the file to be created.

<dt>[EINTR]<dd>
A signal was caught during
<i>fopen()</i>.

<dt>[EISDIR]<dd>
The named file is a directory and
<i>mode</i>
requires write access.

<dt>[ELOOP]<dd>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving <i>path</i>.

<dt>[EMFILE]<dd>
{OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>

The length of the
<i>filename</i>
exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

<dt>[ENFILE]<dd>
The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.

<dt>[ENOENT]<dd>
A component of <i>filename</i> does not name an existing file
or <i>filename</i> is an empty string.

<dt>[ENOSPC]<dd>
The directory or file system that would contain the
new file cannot be expanded, the file does not exist, and
it was to be created.

<dt>[ENOTDIR]<dd>
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

<dt>[ENXIO]<dd>
The named file is a character special or block special file,
and the device associated with this special file does not exist.

<dt>[EOVERFLOW]<dd>
The named file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be
represented correctly in an object of type
<b>off_t</b>.

<dt>[EROFS]<dd>
The named file resides on a read-only file system and
<i>mode</i>
requires write access.

</dl>
<p>
The
<i>fopen()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
The value of the
<i>mode</i>
argument is not valid.

<dt>[EMFILE]<dd>
{FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.

<dt>[EMFILE]<dd>
{STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling process.

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>

Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result whose
length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

<dt>[ENOMEM]<dd>
Insufficient storage space is available.

<dt>[ETXTBSY]<dd>
The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed and
<i>mode</i>
requires write access.
