<h4><a name = "tag_000_005_248">&nbsp;</a>NAME</h4><blockquote>
freopen - open a stream
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_249">&nbsp;</a>SYNOPSIS</h4><blockquote>
<pre><code>

#include &lt;<a href="stdio.h.html">stdio.h</a>&gt;

FILE *freopen(const char *<i>filename</i>, const char *<i>mode</i>, FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</code>
</pre>
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_250">&nbsp;</a>DESCRIPTION</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>freopen()</i>
function first attempts to flush the stream and close any file
descriptor associated with
<i>stream</i>.
Failure to flush or close the file successfully is ignored.
The error and end-of-file indicators for the stream are cleared.
<p>
The
<i>freopen()</i>
function opens the file whose pathname is the string pointed to by
<i>filename</i>
and associates the stream pointed to by
<i>stream</i>
with it.
The
<i>mode</i>
argument is used just as in
<i><a href="fopen.html">fopen()</a></i>.
<p>
The original stream is closed regardless of
whether the subsequent open succeeds.
<p>
After a successful call to the
<i>freopen()</i>
function, the orientation of the stream is cleared and the
associated
<b>mbstate_t</b>
object is set to describe an initial conversion state.
<p>
The largest value that can be represented correctly in an object of type
<b>off_t</b>
will be established as the offset maximum in the open file description.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_251">&nbsp;</a>RETURN VALUE</h4><blockquote>
Upon successful completion,
<i>freopen()</i>
returns the value of
<i>stream</i>.
Otherwise a null pointer is returned and
<i>errno</i>
is set to indicate the error.
</blockquote><h4><a name = "tag_000_005_252">&nbsp;</a>ERRORS</h4><blockquote>
The
<i>freopen()</i>
function will fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EACCES]<dd>
Search permission is denied on a component of the path prefix,
or the file exists and the permissions specified by
<i>mode</i>
are denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is
denied for the parent directory of the file to be created.

<dt>[EINTR]<dd>
A signal was caught during
<i>freopen()</i>.

<dt>[EISDIR]<dd>
The named file is a directory and
<i>mode</i>
requires write access.

<dt>[ELOOP]<dd>
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving <i>path</i>.

<dt>[EMFILE]<dd>
{OPEN_MAX}
file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>

The length of the
<i>filename</i>
exceeds {PATH_MAX} or a pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

<dt>[ENFILE]<dd>
The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the
system.

<dt>[ENOENT]<dd>
A component of <i>filename</i> does not name an existing file
or <i>filename</i> is an empty string.

<dt>[ENOSPC]<dd>
The directory or file system that would contain the
new file cannot be expanded, the file does not exist, and
it was to be created.

<dt>[ENOTDIR]<dd>
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.


<dt>[ENXIO]<dd>
The named file is a character special or block special file,
and the device associated with this special file does not exist.


<dt>[EOVERFLOW]<dd>
The named file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot be
represented correctly in an object of type
<b>off_t</b>.

<dt>[EROFS]<dd>
The named file resides on a read-only file system and
<i>mode</i>
requires write access.

</dl>
<p>
The
<i>freopen()</i>
function may fail if:
<dl compact>

<dt>[EINVAL]<dd>
The value of the
<i>mode</i>
argument is not valid.

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]<dd>

Pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate result whose
length exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

<dt>[ENOMEM]<dd>
Insufficient storage space is available.

<dt>[ENXIO]<dd>
A request was made of a non-existent device, or the request was
outside the capabilities of the device.

<dt>[ETXTBSY]<dd>
The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being
executed and
<i>mode</i>
requires write access.
